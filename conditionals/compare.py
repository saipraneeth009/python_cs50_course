x = int(input("x: "))
y = int(input("y: "))

## Apporach 1
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# if x == y:
#     print("x and y are equal")
# if x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")

## Approach 2
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# elif x == y:
#     print("x and y are equal")
# elif x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")

## Approach 3
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# elif x == y:
#     print("x and y are equal")
# else:
#     print("x is greater than y")

## or operator
# if x<y  or x>y:
#     print("x and y are not equal")
# else:
#     print("x and y are equal")

## Approach 4
# if x == y:
#     print("x and y are equal")
# else:
#     print("x and y are not equal")

## Approach 4.1
# if x != y:
#     print("x and y are not equal")
# else:
#     print("x and y are equal")
